# Chivalry Engine
Chivalry Engine is a free to use and open source engine created by TheMasterGeneral. Built on top of Bootstrap, Chivalry Engine is a mobile-first experience. It should work swell on any modern device.

Chivalry Engine is incomplete, however, for those interested in the developement cycle, we've included download links. The current build is not an indictation on how the final product will end up. We're trying to limit builds to once a week, just so you don't have to constantly check back here.

Feel free to add your own changes and submit them to TheMasterGeneral. If you wish to develope an official module for the engine, please let him know as well.

# Requirements
A web-server with PHP support. Crons not needed. Users need to have Javascript enabled or a lot of the core features won't work.

# Translation
I need people who are willing to translate! Please, let me know!
